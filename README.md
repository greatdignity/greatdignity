## About Me 🚀

I am a passionate **Backend Developer** with experience in **Python, Django, MySQL, Git, and Bash scripting**. I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions. 

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Backend architecture, authentication systems, API development with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Bash scripting**
- 🔭 Working on: **Building simple backend APIs, CLI tools, and automation scripts as part of my ALX Software Engineering journey**
- 🌍 Languages: **Python, Bash, a bit of JavaScript | English, Yoruba**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I made the switch from managing farms and inboxes to managing backend logic — and I still show up early for both**
